    <h1>US FLIGHT DELAYS AND CANCELLATION</h1>

    <div class="container">
      <p>
        When you purchase flight tickets, the airline is responsible for getting you to your destination. 
        However, due to some unforeseen circumstances, flights can be delayed or cancelled. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This visualisation provides information on <span class="bold">how much US flights departing from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) were delayed and how often the flights were cancelled, as well as giving reasons for delays and cancellations for the year 2015</span>.
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 20px;">Note: Information for October 2015 is missing</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2><span class="departdelay">Departure Delay</span> and <span class="arrivedelay">Arrival Delay</span></h2>
      <p>
        There are several reasons why flights are delayed. <span class="Weather">Weather</span> and <span class="Late_aircraft">late aircraft</span> are the 2 major reasons why flights get delayed. 
        Flights are delayed by only few minutes due to <span class="Security">Security reasons</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold"> Flights departing from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) were delayed more on the day of Christmas Eve (Decemeber 24). </span> 
        On this day, flights <span class="departdelay">departed 38 minutes</span> later than scheduled on average, and <span class="arrivedelay">arrived 35 minutes</span> later than scheduled, to their destinations.
        <span class="Late_aircraft">15 minutes delay was due to late aircraft</span> and <span class="Weather">13 minutes delay was due to weather</span>.
      </p>

      <div id="vis1"></div>

      <p>
        <span class="bold">Flights departing from ATL are delayed by at least 5 minutes on average.</span>
        However, it is possible that the delay during arrival (Arrival Delay) is less than the delay during departure (Departure Delay). 
        <span class="bold">In Decemeber 2015, flights travelling to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) <span class="departdelay">departed 15 minutes late</span> from ATL, but <span class="arrivedelay">arrived 10 minutes late</span> than the scheduled arrival.</span>
      </p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Most Delayed Airlines</h2>
      <p>
        Flight delays vary from airline to airline. 
        The following graphs show how airlines are ranked based on departure delay and arrival delay and how these ranks have changed over the year:
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 16px; font-style: italic;">1 = Most delayed.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 16px; font-style: italic;">11 = Least delayed.</p>
      <div id="vis2"></div>
      <p>
        During the month of Christmas, <span class="NK">Spirit Airlines (NK)</span> and <span class="UA">United Airlines (UA)</span> are the top 2 airlines whose flights are delayed, regardless of whether it is during departure or arrival.
        This means <span class="bold">on the day of Christmas Eve, <span class="NK">Spirit Airlines</span> flights and <span class="UA">United Airlines</span> flights are more likely to be delayed longer than any other airline's flights.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="NK">Spirit Airlines (NK)</span> flights <span class="departdelay">departed 27 minutes late</span> and <span class="arrivedelay">arrived to their destinations 29 minutes late</span>.
        <span class="NK">Spirit Airlines</span> has been in the top 3 most delayed Airlines since April.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="UA">United Airlines</span> was ranked as average in the beginning of the year, but at the end of the year it was ranked the second most delayed airlines.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;">
        In <span class="bold">December 2013</span>, <span class="US">US Airways (US)</span> had merged with <span class="AA">American Airlines (AA)</span>. 
        In <span class="bold">July 2015</span>, <span class="AA">American Airlines</span> had announced its plans to discontinue <span class="US">US Airways</span> by <span class="bold">October 2015</span>.
        This could be the reason why there were no <span class="US">US Airways (US)</span> flights that departed from ATL after <span class="bold">June 2015</span>.

      <h2>Percentage of Flights Cancelled</h2>
      <p>
        We saw earlier how common it is for flights to be delayed. 
        It is possible that sometimes flights actually get <span class="cancel">cancelled</span>. 
      </p>
      <div id="vis3"></div>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Although <span class="MQ">American Eagle Airlines (MQ)</span> was not one of the most delayed airlines all the time, it was the top airline for <span class="cancel">cancellations</span> in 2015.</span>
        <span class="bold">8.8%</span> of <span class="MQ">American Eagle Airlines</span> flights were <span class="cancel">cancelled</span>. 
        <span class="airline">2.93%</span> of flights were <span class="cancel">cancelled</span> due to <span class="airline">Airline/Carrier</span>, <span class="airsystem">2.93%</span> <span class="cancel">cancelled</span> due to <span class="airsystem">National Air System</span> and <span class="weather">2.93%</span> <span class="cancel">cancelled</span> due to <span class="weather">Weather</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="OO">Skywest Airlines (OO)</span> had the most <span class="cancel">cancelled</span> flights in <span class="bold">December 2015 (4.79%)</span>. 
        <span class="weather">3.59%</span> <span class="cancel">cancelled</span> due to <span class="weather">Weather</span> and <span class="airline">1.20%</span> <span class="cancel">cancelled</span> due to <span class="airline">Airline/Carrier</span>.
        <span class="bold">Therefore, <span class="OO">Skywest Airlines</span> flights are more likely to be <span class="cancel">cancelled</span> during Christmas time.</span>
